#### Welcome to MentorMe, a video mentorship app for girls. My app is a Ruby on Rails full-stack application with full CRUD capabilites. It allows girls interested in STEM subjects to find capable, experienced mentors to inspire, encourage and instruct them to excel. Mentor-mentee pairs are encouraged to video chat about subjects, homework help, and informational interviews to encourage girls to pursue their passions.



## Technologies Used


#### I used Ruby on Rails using Materialize for styling and adding components. I decided to use WebRTC API to enable video communication between mentors and mentees.

## Challenges


#### I had some challenges during the development phase, namely with associations and assigning a mentor to a student. The API was hard to format, but I plan to continue with the app and improve it, adding new features and user-friendly interfaces.



## Future Goals


#### I plan to add more features, such as messaging between mentors and students, and allowing students to friend other students and post content in forums. I plan to update my associations and allow a many-to-many relationship between mentors and students, and add an organizational tool for students to set goals and track their progress with their mentors.



## Shoutouts


#### Thanks to Ben and Michael who helped me with my two-user sign in model. I'd also like to thank all the consultants and TAs who helped me along the way, their support is much appreciated. I'd also like to thank Vanessa for being a constant supporter, Jen Wayne and Kate for being good study buddies. Thanks to my entire cohort for working hard and pushing ourselves to succeed!
