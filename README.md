# Final Project
##A mentorship app for girls with video chat capabilities

#### Welcome to Hopper, a video mentorship app for girls. My app is a Ruby on Rails full-stack application with full CRUD capabilites. It allows girls interested in STEM subjects to find capable, experienced mentors to inspire, encourage and instruct them to excel. Mentor-mentee pairs are encouraged to video chat about subjects, homework help, and informational interviews to encourage girls to pursue their passions.
