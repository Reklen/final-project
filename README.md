#### Welcome to MentorMe, a video mentorship app for girls. My app is a Ruby on Rails full-stack application with full CRUD capabilites. It allows girls interested in STEM subjects to find capable, experienced mentors to inspire, encourage and instruct them to excel. Mentor-mentee pairs are encouraged to video chat about subjects, homework help, and informational interviews to encourage girls to pursue their passions.


#### I decided to use WebRTC API to enable video communication between mentors and mentees

#### I had some challenges during the development phase, namely with associations and assigning a mentor to a student. The API was hard to format, but I plan to continue with the app and improve it, adding new features and user-friendly interfaces.
